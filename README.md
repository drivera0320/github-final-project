## Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration. It includes a calculator that computes simple interest using a straightforward formula. 

---

## Features

- Takes three user inputs: principal amount, annual interest rate, and time in years.
- Computes simple interest based on the formula:
  \[
  \text{Simple Interest} = P \times T \times R
  \]
- Easy to use and customizable.

---

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs:
- `P`: Principal amount (e.g., 1000, 5000)
- `T`: Time period in years (e.g., 2, 5)
- `R`: Annual rate of interest (e.g., 0.05 for 5%)

### Output:
- `Simple Interest`: The calculated simple interest.
